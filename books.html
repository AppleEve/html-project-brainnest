    <h3>Favourite books</h3>
    <p>
      Reading was always among my favourite ways to kill time and I am very
      happy I grew up in a time when I couldn't be distracted from it by the
      temptations of the Internet. Being a new mum I barely ever have time to
      read but I just cannot wait to reenter the world of imagination together
      with my daughter. There are some books, that I have already red a milion
      times and I know I will always come back to in the future:
