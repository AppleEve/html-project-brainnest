    <h2>The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared</h2>
    <p>
      This is one of the most hilarious and clever books I have ever red.
      Telling a colourful and eventful story of Allan Karlsson, it mixes his
      fantastic adventures with historical events in a Forest-Gump-like way. As
      funny as the movie may be, the book is so much more!
