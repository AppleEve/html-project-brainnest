    <h2>Master and Margerita</h2>
    <p>
      Master and Margerita were a school reading in high school. And as such, I
      expected a boring and out-dated novel that will keep me away from better
      things to do. Instead, I got an exquisite masterpiece full of black
      humour, philosophy and fantasy. I was so impressed, it became one of my
      favourite books and I return to it whenever I want my mind to be
      challanged. I find something new with every read!
