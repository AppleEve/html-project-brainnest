    <h2>Como</h2>
    <p>
      The first time I've been to Como was as a student. I was visiting my
      friend in Milan and he brought me to Como as an attraction. I was
      absolutely stunned by the beauty of the Como lake and the charming city
      laying by it. Since my first visit I have been to Como 3 or 4 more times
      and it's always a must-go whenever in the Northern Italy.
