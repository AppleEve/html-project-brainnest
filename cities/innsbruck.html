    <h2>Innsbruck</h2>
    <p>
      Austria will always and forever be the land of mountains and snow. And
      though of course it is not true, me and family would go every winter to
      ski in Austria, passing by the beautiful country covered in snow. On our
      way, we would pass a day or two in charming and heart-warming Innsbruck.
      Now that one of my best friends lives there, I still keep regularily
      visiting the city.
