    <h2>Warsaw Airport</h2>
    <p>
      I know of course that an airport is not a city and maybe it does not fit
      the rest of the list... but, the Warsaw Airport is one of my favourite
      places in the world. And not because of its beauty or attractions (as it
      is not and it has none ðŸ˜‚), but becasue of the feeling it gives me. When I
      was still living in Warsaw being at the airport meant awaiting new
      adventures, new places to visit, new people to meet, new memories to make.
      Now, it means coming back to my friends and family which gives the same
      heart-warming feelings.
