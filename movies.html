    <h3>Favourite movies</h3>
    <p>
      Before I moved to Cyprus, this time of the year, beginning of the fall
      meant colder days, longer nights, wet socks and permanently runny nose.
      But it also meant long, guilt-free evenings spent on watching movies!
      Here's a list of some movies that I would always come back to in specific
      moments of the year:
