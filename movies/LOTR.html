    <h2>Lord of the Rings Series</h2>
    <p>
      Maybe becasue the movies were coming out around New Year's , or becasue of
      the adventurous character of the plot that brights up long winter
      evenings, but I always watch the LOTR trilogy beginning of the year. I am
      exited just the same (or more!) whenever I hear Cate Blanchett's
      intruduction to the series. <br />
