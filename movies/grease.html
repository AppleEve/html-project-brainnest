    <h2>Grease</h2>
    <p>
      Grease is a definition of a great summer movie. And though I am not sure
      if it aged well, I will forever love everything about it - the characters,
      the plot and the music. Grease has been with me since I discovered it in
      my early teenage years and I love to rewatch it whenever feeling like
      singing out loud along John Travolta. Not to be taken seriously! <br />
