    <h2>Love Actually</h2>
    <p>
      Want to put myself in Christmas mood? I will always reach for Love
      Actually. I can still rememebr seeing the movie in the cinema for the
      first time. And then seeing it 3 more times in the cinema after that. And
      then watching it every year around Christmas time since! <br />
